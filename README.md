 Problem Statement: Build a two-wheeler marketplace web app

Summary: Build a two-wheeler marketplace web app where users can browse bikes, scooters, and EVs, search and filter by brand, price, or fuel type, view detailed specs with images, compare model's side by side, use EMI and fuel cost calculators, check upcoming launches, explore showrooms, and book test rides or sell used bikes.

-------------------
Problem Understanding:
"Vahan Bazar is an online platform for buying and selling two-wheelers, where users need an easy way to browse, filter, compare, and book vehicles, including second-hand options."
--------------------
Proposed protype solution:
Urban buyers and sellers of two-wheelers face fragmented listings, inconsistent filters, and poor test-ride booking flows, which increases time-to-purchase and customer drop-off. Vahaan-Bazar is a web marketplace prototype that consolidates new and second-hand bikes, scooters and EVs with unified filtering (brand, price, fuel type ,side-by-side comparison, and one-click test-ride booking). The prototype uses a React front-end, back-end and a small MongoDB dataset to demonstrate search, filter and booking flows; screenshots and a demo video show the end-to-end user journey. What makes Vahaan-Bazar unique is its combined “second-hand score” (automated condition scoring from seller inputs) and an end-to-end test-ride scheduler that integrates dealer availability — reducing buyer search time and improving lead quality for sellers. The expected impact is faster, better-informed purchases and higher conversion for local dealers; the solution is lightweight and designed to scale to additional cities and vehicle types.
